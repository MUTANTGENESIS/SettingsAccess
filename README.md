# SettingsAccess

## Why

As of macOS 14 Sonoma:

- Apple completely removed the ability to open the SwiftUI Settings scene using legacy `NSApp.sendAction()` method using the `showSettingsWindow:` (macOS 13) or `showPreferencesWindow:` (macOS 12 and earlier) selectors. The only available method of opening the Settings scene (apart from the _App menu ‚Üí Settings_ menu item) is to use the new [`SettingsLink`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/settingslink) view.

  ![No Dice](Images/no-dice.png)

- This presents two major restrictions:
  1. There is no way to detect when the user has clicked this button if additional code is desired to run before or after the opening of the `Settings` scene.
  2. There is **no** way to programmatically open the `Settings` scene.
  
- These restrictons become problematic in many scenarios. Some examples that are currently impossible without **SettingsAccess**:
  - You are building a window-based `MenuBarExtra` and want to have a button that opens `Settings` and also dismisses the window.
  - You want to open the `Settings` scene in response to a user action in your application that requires the user manipulate a setting that may be invalid.

## Solution

- **SettingsAccess** provides an environment method called `openSettings()` that can be called anywhere in the view hierarchy to programmatically open the Settings scene. (See [Getting Started](#Getting-Started) below for an example of its usage.)

- **SettingsAccess** is also backwards compatible from macOS 11 Big Sur and later. Calling `openSettings()` will use the correct method to open the Settings scene for each supported operating system automatically.
- No private API is used, so it is safe for the Mac App Store.

## How It Works (For Nerds)

`SettingsLink` is a view that wraps a standard SwiftUI `Button` and its action calls a private environment method called `_openSettings` which we have no access to publicly. (A radar has been submitted asking Apple to make it public, but until that happens - if ever - **SettingsAccess** is the solution.)

Also, due to how SwiftUI `Button` works, it is impossible to attach a simultaneous gesture to attempt to detect a button press.

**SettingsAccess** uses a custom `Button` style which, when applied directly to `SettingsLink`, allows us to capture the `Button` press action and export a wrapper method as an environment method called `openSettings` that we can use.

## Using the Package

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Add SettingsAccess as a dependency using Swift Package Manager.

- In an app project or framework, in Xcode:

  Select the menu: **File ‚Üí Swift Packages ‚Üí Add Package Dependency...**

  Enter this URL: `https://github.com/orchetect/SettingsAccess`

- In a Swift Package, add it to the Package.swift dependencies:

  ```swift
  .package(url: "https://github.com/orchetect/SettingsAccess", from: "1.0.0")
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Import the library.

   ```swift
   import SettingsAccess
   ```

2. Attach the `openSettingsAccess` view modifier to the base view which needs access to the `openSettings` method.

   ```swift
   @main
   struct MyApp: App {
       var body: some Scene {
           WindowGroup {
               ContentView()
                   .openSettingsAccess()
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. In any subview where needed, add the environment method declaration. Then the Settings scene may be opened programmatically by calling this method.

   ```swift
   struct ContentView: View {
       @Environment(\.openSettings) private var openSettings
     
       var body: some View {
           Button("Open Settings") { openSettings() }
       }
   }
   ```
