## Why

As of macOS 14 Sonoma:

- Apple completely removed the ability to open the SwiftUI Settings scene using legacy `NSApp.sendAction()` method using the `showSettingsWindow:` (macOS 13) or `showPreferencesWindow:` (macOS 12 and earlier) selectors.
- The only available method of opening the Settings scene apart from the _App menu ‚Üí Settings_ menu item is to use the new [`SettingsLink`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/settingslink) view.
- This presents two major restrictions:
  1. `SettingsLink` is a view that wraps a standard SwiftUI `Button`. There is no way to detect when the user has clicked this button if additional code is desired to run in addition to the intrinsic behavior of opening the Settings scene. Due to how SwiftUI works, it is impossible to attach a simultaneous gesture to attempt to detect a button press.
  2. There is **no** way to programmatically open the Settings scene.
- These restrictons become problematic in many scenarios. Some examples that are currently impossible without SettingsAccess:
  - You are building a window-based MenuBarExtra and want to have a button that opens Settings and also dismisses the window.
  - You want to open the Settings scene in reponse to a user action in your application that requires the user manipulate a setting that may be invalid.

## Solution

1. SettingsAccess provides a custom button style that can be applied directly to `SettingsLink` in order to execute code before and/or after the button press action occurs.
2. SettingsAccess provides an environment method called `openSettings` that can be called anywhere in the view hierarchy to programmatically open the Settings scene.

## Getting Started

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

1. Add SettingsAccess as a dependency using Swift Package Manager.

   - In an app project or framework, in Xcode:

     Select the menu: **File ‚Üí Swift Packages ‚Üí Add Package Dependency...**

     Enter this URL: `https://github.com/orchetect/SettingsAccess`

   - In a Swift Package, add it to the Package.swift dependencies:

     ```swift
     .package(url: "https://github.com/orchetect/SettingsAccess", from: "1.0.0")
     ```

2. Import the library:

   ```swift
   import SettingsAccess
   ```

3. Try the [Demo](Demo) example project to see the library in action.

## Requirements
